# Stock Market Analysis with LSTM

Welcome to the Stock Market Analysis project! This project focuses on leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to predict stock prices using time-series data. Built using Python and Jupyter Notebooks, it aims to provide accurate and insightful forecasting of stock market trends.

## Project Overview

The Stock Market Analysis project is designed to predict stock prices by training LSTM models on historical time-series data. This project includes data preprocessing, model training, backtesting, and detailed visualizations to provide comprehensive insights into stock market trends and prediction results.

## Features

- **LSTM Model Training**: Designed and trained LSTM models to forecast stock prices, capturing complex temporal dependencies in time-series data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and transformed historical stock market data for effective model training, including normalization and feature engineering.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Performed detailed analysis of stock market trends to understand historical price movements and predict future trends.
- **Visualizations**: Created detailed visualizations using Python libraries to illustrate stock market trends, prediction results, and model performance.
- **Backtesting and Model Tuning**: Conducted rigorous backtesting and tuning of LSTM models to enhance prediction accuracy and ensure reliable performance metrics.
